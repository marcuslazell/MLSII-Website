        <p>We operate the GAMELIFE mobile application (the "App").</p>
        <p>
            We are committed to protecting your privacy. The core philosophy of GAMELIFE is to use data to empower
            you, not to exploit you. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the
            choices you have regarding your data.
        </p>
        <p>By downloading and using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <section class="privacy-policy-section">
            <h2>1. The Core Principle: On-Device Processing</h2>
            <p>
                GAMELIFE is designed with privacy as a fundamental pillar. To the maximum extent possible, sensitive
                data related to your health, location, and device usage is processed locally on your iPhone.
            </p>
            <p><strong>We do not sell your personal data to third parties, advertisers, or data brokers.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="privacy-policy-section">
            <h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
            <p>We collect data to facilitate the core functionality of the App: gamifying your real-life behaviors.</p>

            <h3>A. Information You Voluntarily Provide</h3>
            <p>When you set up the App, you may provide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RPG Profile Data:</strong> Your "Origin Story," custom quest names, project ("Boss") names, and reward definitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Preferences for notifications and app behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> To personalize your gameplay experience and store your in-game progress locally on your device.</p>

            <h3>B. Health Data (via Apple HealthKit)</h3>
            <p><strong>What we collect:</strong></p>
            <p>
                With your explicit permission, GAMELIFE integrates with Apple's HealthKit framework to read specific
                data points relevant to your "Physical" stats (for example, Strength and Vitality). This may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step count</li>
                <li>Sleep analysis</li>
                <li>Exercise minutes or workout data</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> This data is read locally to automatically update your in-game statistics and complete physical quests (for example, "Walk 10k steps").</p>
            <p><strong>Specific HealthKit Disclosure:</strong> We will not use your HealthKit data for advertising or similar services. We will not sell your HealthKit data to advertising platforms, data brokers, or information resellers. Your HealthKit data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

            <h3>C. Device Activity Data (via Screen Time API)</h3>
            <p><strong>What we collect:</strong></p>
            <p>
                With your explicit permission via the iOS FamilyControls framework, GAMELIFE uses the DeviceActivity
                framework to monitor aggregate usage time of specific groups of apps that you select.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not know which specific apps you are using.</li>
                <li>We do not see the content inside any apps.</li>
                <li>We only receive a system signal when a time threshold you set is met by a group of apps (for example, "Productive Apps group used for 30 minutes").</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> This data is used solely to provide positive reinforcement for digital well-being goals. For example, if you reach your goal for using educational apps, the App will award you "Intelligence" XP.</p>

            <h3>D. Location Data (via Core Location)</h3>
            <p><strong>What we collect:</strong></p>
            <p>
                With your explicit permission, GAMELIFE may use location services to define specific geographic zones
                related to your goals (for example, a gym or library).
            </p>
            <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> The App monitors entry and exit times for these specific zones locally on your device to auto-complete location-based quests (for example, "Spent 45 minutes at the gym"). Your precise location history is not tracked or stored by us.</p>

            <h3>E. Usage Data and Analytics</h3>
            <p>We may collect anonymized, aggregated usage data to help us improve the App's stability and performance. This may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
                <li>Crash reports</li>
                <li>General engagement metrics (for example, which features are most popular)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We use no third-party analytics services.</p>

        <section class="privacy-policy-section">
            <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>
                The majority of your sensitive data, including health and activity tracking, resides solely on your
                iOS device. If you use iCloud Backup, your app data will be encrypted and stored by Apple according to
                their iCloud security policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited data we may handle from unauthorized
                access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet
                or electronic storage is 100% secure.

        <section class="privacy-policy-section">
            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                The App may contain links to third-party websites or services (for example, if you link a reward to an
                external site). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage
                you to read their privacy policies.

            <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                GAMELIFE is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
                personally identifiable information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal
                data from a child without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information
                from our servers.

            <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can revoke the App’s access to HealthKit, Screen Time, Location, or Notifications at any time in iOS Settings. Doing so may disable related features in the App.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Because most data is stored locally, deleting the App from your device will remove the majority of data associated with GAMELIFE.</li>
            </ul>
